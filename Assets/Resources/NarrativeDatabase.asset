      - There was once a humble shopkeeper possessed of a rare and obscure talent.
      - By taking mystically infused gems and binding them to rock figurines, stone
        could be brought to life.
      - This Golemancer made their living traveling from town to town, seeking new
        crafting materials and selling golems to any locals that took a fancy.
      - Though small and simple, there was something captivating about the Golems.  Watching
        them romp and cavort, the Golemancer couldn't shake the feeling that there
        was more to them.
      - A secret.
