    - Texts:
      - There was once a humble shopkeeper possessed of a rare and obscure talent.
      - By taking mystically infused gems and binding them to rock figurines, stone
        could be brought to life.
      - This Golemancer made their living traveling from town to town, seeking new
        crafting materials and selling golems to any locals that took a fancy.
      - Though small and simple, there was something captivating about the Golems.  Watching
        them romp and cavort, the Golemancer couldn't shake the feeling that there
        was more to them.
      - A secret.
      Unlocked: 0
    - Texts:
      - The Golemancer had made many shells before, but this one was special.  It
        seemed to be already alive and moving.
      Unlocked: 0
    - Texts:
      - Though all jewels be blessed with beauty, this one was sublime.  It gleamed
        and sparkled, pulsing like a beating heart.
      Unlocked: 0
    - Texts:
      - The mystic energies dissipated to reveal a golem, but this one was nothing
        like what had come before.
      Unlocked: 0
    - Texts:
      - As the exquisite jewel entered the golem shell, the Golemancer could see a
        familiarity to the eddies of magical energy forming.
      - The cadence and motion of the mystic currents had the distinct puissance of
        a greater conjuring.
      - All at once there came a violent burst and the head sockets of the Golem shell
        lit up.  It fixed it's newly glowing eyes on the Golemancer and said...
      Unlocked: 0
    - Texts:
      - The golem shell shook with a violent locomotion as the energy from it's embedded
        jewel coursed through it.
      - It finally came to a halt, slumping into a kneeling crouch on the floor.
      - The newly created golem raised it's still glowing head to look up at the Golemancer
        and said...
      Unlocked: 0
    - Texts:
      - Rolling ripples of force and mana eddied around the workshop and a confluence
        of spellcraft clung to the merging shell and jewel.
      - For a moment the stone figure's form was obscured in a brilliant sphere of
        light.
      - When the blinding radiance subsided, a newly formed golem stood.  It locked
        it's gaze on the Golemancer and said...
      Unlocked: 0
    - Texts:
      - In the northlands, the vast valley of Giant's Pass winds through the frigid
        tundra.  Many say that it was created when the great sky serpent descended
        in welcome of the first winter.
      - The inhabitants of Giant's Pass liberally employ windmills and turbines to
        harness the powerful winds of their valley.  They use the resultant energy
        to power their homes and launch great airships.
      - Thanks to these feats of ingenuity, Giant's Pass artificers are celebrated
        all over Zauberheim.  Many brave the long journey North in search of innovation
        and knowledge.
      Unlocked: 0
    - Texts:
      - Scorching waves of magma and sooty air are not what most folk would call comfy,
        but the Pyrochemisters of Flaming Peak would have it no other way.
      - Living atop an active volcano affords them easy access to the volatile energies
        they require to carry out their enigmatic experiments.
      - Despite their eccentricities, the townsfolk of Flaming Peak are known for
        being excellent hosts.  Visitors often leave with smiles on their faces, despite
        many a missing eyebrow.
      Unlocked: 0
    - Texts:
      - "Often referred to as \u201Cthe crown\u201D, the warm gleam of Sky City\u2019s
        walls can be seen from nearly any point in Zauberheim.  The Sky Witches who
        make their home there are known for being simultaneously welcoming and haughty."
      - 'They maintain a vibrant trade hub on the ground, where all are free to buy
        and sell.  However, access to the lofty city gates is gained only through
        express invitation, an honour rarely extended. '
      - 'This strict boundary does little to tarnish the image of Sky City, and it
        remains one of the most popular locations in Zauberheim.    '
      Unlocked: 0
    - Texts:
      - Many view the druids of Wicked Grove as deceptively doddery, belying their
        secretive and conniving natures.
      - Though all agree as to the vast knowledge kept beneath the oaks and willows,
        few dare venture past the forest borders.
      - This reputation suits the druids just fine, as they prefer to deal with the
        bold and ambitious, over the conservative and complacent.  Visitors displaying
        sufficient wit are welcomed, and once earnt a druid's friendship lasts a lifetime.
