    line: That's a done deal!  Hopefully this time my fingers won't freeze off when
      I journey up the mountain.

    line: A fair price, than you for providing me with a companion to warm my journey.
  - chance: 0
    line: You drive a hard bargain, but lucky for you I really need a companion to
      keep me warm on the journey ahead.

  - chance: 0.66
    line: I'd never pay that much!  I wasn't born yesterday you know?!  Be reasonable.
  - chance: 0.33
    line: That's too expensive.  Would you really leave an old wizard out in the cold
      without a helper to guide his way?  Make me a better offer.
  - chance: 0.22
    line: Listen PUNK.
  - chance: 0
    line: Make me a better offer so I can take this toasty fella home already.

    line: I'd sooner cut off my beard than pay that ludicrous amount!  Good day!
  - chance: 0.33
    line: Your heart is clearly as cold as ice to be shovelling wares for that amount.  Good
      day!
  - chance: 0
    line: I'm simply in too much of a rush to barter with someone as unreasonable
      as you.  Good day!
